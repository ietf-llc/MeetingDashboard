During meetings (and other times) you can see a status of key systems at [https://status.ietf.org/](https://status.ietf.org/). 

Wish list for other live stats / changes during a meeting:
1. Issue reporting: currently via email to support@ietf.org. Why not to a web-based ticketing system directly, with Datatracker SSO, that allows all attendees 
to see open tickets? This could cut down on duplicate reports and enable people to follow the status of any tickets of interest, to add comments, etc.
2. Live AP stats: number of APs online / offline / impaired, clients connected to each & total, traffic volume, etc. (and historical since the network was set up)
3. Live network stats: connected devices, current upstream and downstream traffic volume (and historical since the network was set up).
4. Netflow/IPfix flow visualization: such as ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/895c64f4-dc57-4b3a-9925-16cb330ba052)
5. Address Family Stats: mix of IPv4 vs IPv6 traffic flows & volume
6. Wi-Fi WMM Stats: flows in AC_BE, VI, VO, BK
7. ECN Stats: flows marked ECN-capable and CE
8. DSCP Stats: show stats for DSCP marking for inbound & outbound traffic
9. ??


For any significant outages (such as Datatracker at IETF-121) send out a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) report of the issue. And maybe have an archive of RCAs someplace.
